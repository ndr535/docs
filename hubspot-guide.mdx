# Quickstart

Get up and running on the latest version of HubSpot's developer platform.

Get started with app development by building and deploying a simple boilerplate app.

<Callout type="tip">
If you don't have a developer account yet, click [here](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/crm?intent=developer&uuid=56cba8a3-cc4d-4641-9656-103d206b6c5f) to create a new developer account. If you previously created a developer account prior to August 29, 2025, check out [this guide](/docs/getting-started/convert-your-account-into-a-developer-crm-account) for details on opting into the new developer platform.
</Callout>

## Set up your local environment

Before getting started, install the latest version of the **HubSpot CLI**. In a terminal window, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @hubspot/cli && hs init
```
The CLI needs to be version `7.6.0` or later.

You can check which version of the CLI you have by running `hs --version`.

If needed, you can run the command `npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest` to update to the latest version of the HubSpot CLI.

The `hs init` command will create a CLI configuration file and authenticate your HubSpot account.
* Follow the prompts to generate a **Personal Access Key** in your account, then copy and paste it into the terminal to save your configuration.
* It's recommended that you make this account your **default** in the CLI.
* You can run `hs account auth` at any time to authenticate a different HubSpot account.

## Create and upload a project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get started">
    With the CLI installed, run `hs get-started` to initialize your project.

    ```
    hs get-started
    ```    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your project details">
    You'll then be greeted with a welcome message, and you can begin setting up your project and app.

    *   Following the prompts, select **App**.

    ![Build an app using the HubSpot CLI](https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/Knowledge_Base_2023-24-25/terminal/hubspot-cli-hs-get-started-select.png)

    *   Give your project a **name**.
    *   Set your project's **local directory** (by default this will be your current working directory).
    *   Upload your project to HubSpot to initialize the first build and deploy.

    ![Upload your project using the HubSpot CLI](https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/Knowledge_Base_2023-24-25/terminal/hubspot-cli-hs-get-started-upload.png)

    *   You'll then be prompted to install dependencies and upload your project. Installing dependencies before uploading ensures a faster build of the included app card, and makes sure that your local development environment and production match. This step will add a `package-lock.json` file and Node modules directory to the project's `cards/` directory.
    *   Then, confirm that you want to upload your project to your account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Install and preview your app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install your app">
    After your project deploys, you'll be prompted to navigate to your HubSpot account to walk through installing and previewing your app.

    *   In the terminal, confirm that you want to open your account. A browser window will open the project details page in HubSpot.
    *   On the project details page, click **Install now** to install the app. You'll then be taken to the app install page.

    ![HubSpot project settings page showing highlighted 'Install now' button for installing the project app](https://developers.hubspot.com/hubfs/Knowledge_Base_2023-24-25/developer-projects/hs-get-started-install-now.png)

    *   On the app install page, click **Connect App** to install the app in your account.
    *   A confirmation message will appear once the app successfully installs. You can then close the page or click **return home**.

    At any time, you can return to the project details page either through the terminal or in HubSpot:

    *   In the terminal, run `hs project open` while in the local project directory.
    *   In HubSpot, navigate to **Development** in the main navigation bar, then locate your project under _Recently updated projects_ or through the left sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start local development">
    With the project uploaded and installed, you can start the local development server to preview your app card.

    *   In the terminal, navigate into your project directory, then run `hs project dev`.

    As of [Google Chrome version 142](https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/142#local_network_access_restrictions), you will receive a one time time popup asking for _app.hubspot.com_ to access devices on your local network. Select **Accept** to enable local development for your apps.  
      
    You can also manage this setting in your Chrome settings by navigating to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **app.hubspot.com** > **Permissions** > **Local network access**.

    *   When prompted, select the account you want to test in.
        *   To test in a developer test account within your production account (recommended), select **Test on a developer test account**.
        *   Select an existing test account, or select **Test on a new developer test account**. Then, follow the prompts to install the app in the test account.

    For more advanced testing, you can create [configurable test accounts](/docs/developer-tooling/local-development/configurable-test-accounts), which can be assigned specific combinations of HubSpot subscription tiers to ensure feature compatibility.

    *   The local development server will then start, and the terminal will provide a link to view the local dev session in HubSpot. Follow the link to open the HubSpot local development page in your account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup local development preview">
    Before you can preview the app card on the contact record, you'll need to add your new card to the contact record view.

    *   On the local development page, click **Setup preview**. You'll then be redirected to the contacts index page.

    ![Screenshot of the local development page in HubSpot](https://developers.hubspot.com/hubfs/Knowledge_Base_2023-24-25/developer-projects/local-development-page-in-hubspot-setup-preview.png)

    *   Click the **name** of a contact record.
    *   At the top of the middle column of the contact record, click **Customize**.
    *   Click **Default view**.
    *   Select the **tab** that you want to add the card to. You can then hover over the location where you want to place the card and click the **plus button**. This can be adjusted at any time after initial setup.

    ![Screenshot showing the plus button to add a card to the contact record view](https://developers.hubspot.com/hubfs/Knowledge_Base_2023-24-25/developer-projects/contact-record-view-setup.png)

    *   In the right sidebar, click the **Card library** tab. Then, click the **Card types** dropdown menu and select **App** to filter for app cards.
    *   Click **Add card** under the app card you created, then click the **close** button in the top right of the sidebar.
    *   In the top right, click **Save and exit**.

    You'll then be redirected back to the contact record, and the app card will display with a `Developing locally` tag to indicate that the local development server is waiting to detect local changes.

    ![Screenshot showing the app card rendered on the contact timeline with the Developing Locally tag](https://developers.hubspot.com/hubfs/Knowledge_Base_2023-24-25/developer-projects/contact-record-app-card-developing-locally-tag.png)

    You will not need to repeat the preview setup steps moving forward, unless you want to change the position of the card or customize another CRM record view.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue local development">
    While the local development server runs, it will automatically pick up on any changes saved to the app card's front-end React file. If you need to make changes to other file types, such as a `.json` configuration file, you'll need to reupload the project and restart the local development server.To test this out, make a change to the app card's local `.jsx` React file, then save your change. For example, change the text within one of the `Text` [components](/docs/apps/developer-platform/add-features/ui-extensibility/ui-components/standard-components/text).

    ![Screenshot showing the app card update based on a saved code change](https://developers.hubspot.com/hubfs/Knowledge_Base_2023-24-25/developer-projects/contact-record-app-card-developing-locally-tag-updated-code.png)

    ```jsx
    import React from "react";
    import { Text, Link, List } from "@hubspot/ui-extensions";
    import { hubspot } from "@hubspot/ui-extensions";
    
    hubspot.extend(() => <Extension />);
    
    const Extension = () => {
      return (
        <>
          <Text>
            Woohoo!
          </Text>
